In this repository, I collect my solutions to the Google Code Jam problems. These files include both solutions I submitted during contests as well as solutions I have written for practice after the contests had ended. For the sake of consistency and readability, I have omitted the solutions I created during the Code Jams of 2012 and 2013 (in Java), and have started afresh in Python in 2014. I might clean those up sometime, and add them here.
