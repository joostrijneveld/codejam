In this repository, I collect my solutions to the Google Code Jam problems. These files include both solutions I submitted during contests as well as solutions I have written for practice after the contests had ended. For the sake of consistency and readability, I have omitted the solutions I created during the Code Jams of 2012 and 2013 (in Java), and have started afresh in Python in 2014. I might clean those up sometime, and add them here.

As readability is a main goal of the solutions presented here, I have refrained from (micro-)optimisations that have a negative impact on readability and do not benefit the running time or complexity significantly.

### China New Grad Test 2014

Note that the Practice Round is a subset of EuroPython 2013 and was thus omitted.
